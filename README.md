# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Homeworks

Overall Comment: I found this homework to be very challenging and consulted AskBCS several times for assistence. I have cited them in my sources. I also used an existing repository to help understand the flow of the code, however the coding I did for this assignment was of my own making because there were several unique elements that made coding each line the best way to get the assignment done as well as understand how the code was working. I believe I am learning coding, however I still don't think I'm ready to do it on my own without help from tutors and sources found on Google.

Comment: This code was helpful primarily in checking my the results of my code when to verify I was getting the correct results. There were some neat formatting ideas in this code, however I realized the hard way that if you format a    number with a symbol it turns it into a string and you can no longer perform math with that string later when you need a calculation. Also, this code seemed to have errors and or missing lines compared to what I ended up creating with the help of AskBCS tutors.
